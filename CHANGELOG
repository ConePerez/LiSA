--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
known issues
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
loading of *.lsa files is to generous, you may get undefined results from 
uncorrect files instead of error messages

the iterative improvement algorithm may terminate before reaching a local
optimum in enumeration mode

for job shop and flow shop problems you can enter latin rectangles that do not
fit to the given machine order ... this doesn't even give you an error message

schedules that are not semiactive may be edited manually, this may also lead to
invalid schedules, but no error checking occurs

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
upcoming version
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

enabled new oben shop algorithm by P. Brucker

changed files and algorithm IO to xml

rewrote and streamlined error handling class

Smith Rule is exact for sumWiCi, not sumWiTi. <- fixed

Enabled further neighbourhoods for the neighbourhood search algorithms.

Fixed some minor bugs in the GUI.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LiSA 2.3final
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No real new features, this is a bugfix and consolidation release.

Source code should now be c++ standard compatible.

LiSA can now be compiled with Intel's C++ Compiler 7.0. This has great speed
advantages for example with the Branch and Bound algorithm.

Directory structure reorganised. Makefiles adapted.

Classification module no longer used to determine usable algorithms. This was
no longer possible, since the algorithms are unable to do even trivial 
transformations.

Replaced LiSA's string class with the standard string class. Fixed bugs 
resulting from that.

While reading from files the syntax is checked more strict.

LiSA's now compatible with Tcl/Tk 8.4 and earlier versions.

Numerous crash reasons fixed, both in algorithms and the main program.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
LiSA 2.3pre2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prerelease, showed at the student part of the annual DMV conference in 2002.

This version already contained most of the changes from 2.3final, but was never
released to the public.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LiSA 2.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Added various new algorithms made by studends in computer labs. (Beam Search,
Gonzales and Sahni reducing set algorithm, Johnson Rule, LAPT Rule, MS Rule)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LiSA 2.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   	
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
LiSA 1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Initial release.
