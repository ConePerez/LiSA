<H2>Input problem type</H2>
To examine a scheduling problem whit LiSA first you have to specify a
problem type in the 3 field notation according to Graham et al..
Here you can also choose the number of jobs and machines.

<H2>This is how you get here:</H2>
Choose <I>File|New</I> to enter a new problem type or <I>
Edit|Problem Type</I> to modify an existing one.

<H2>Options</H2>
All options follow the usual conventions of the 3 field notation as
explained in each scheduling text book.
<BR>In addition to the objective functions usually examined in
classical scheduling theory, you may specify one of the following
functions:
<UL>
<LI> IRREG1= Sum |C_i - d_i |
<LI> IRREG2= w_late * L_max + w_early * max (d_i - C_i)^+ + Sum w_i
     T_i + Sum wi_early (d_i - C_i)^+ <BR>
     Note that this objective functions requires a problem definition
     outside LiSA because of the additional weights.
</UL>
<H2>Exceptions</H2>
<UL>
<LI> LiSA always tries to accept your last input. In case of
inconsistent input, some erlier inputs may be modified. For instance
when you choose multiprocessor tasks in a one machine problem, the
problem type is modified to parallel machines. 
<LI> LiSA is continously extended and can display several 
thousends of problem types. Thus it may be possible that an entered
problem type cannot be handled in LiSA.
