<H2>The Gantt Chart
</H2>
Different appearances of the gantt chart can be choosen in the menu 
<I> Options|Gantt Chart</I> if a schedule is present.

<H2>Basic Choices</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Orientation: Choose job oriented or machine oriented display. In a
job oriented gantt chart (each job in one seperate row), also release
times and due dates are displayed.
<LI>Special Emphasis: Beside the appearance "Normal" (fixed assignment
of up to 23 well distinguished colors) you can choose "Critical Path"
(operations on a critical path are red, all others gray) or you can
choose some colors for special jobs. 
<BR> 
Critical pathes are only recognized for a C_max objective criterion.
