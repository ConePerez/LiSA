<H2> General Branch &amp; Bound Algorithm </H2>

Use this algorithm to minimize any regular objective function for job
shop, flow shop, open shop or one machine problems exactly or
heuristicly if there is no specific algorithm to solve this problem.
Because this algorithm needs exponential time, it cannot be applied to
big problem instances. 
<P>
<H2>What you have to do:</H2> 
<P>
Make sure that both a 
<A HREF="problem.htm"> problem type </A> and all 
<A HREF="values.htm"> parameters </A> 
are defined. Choose <I>Exact Algorithms|Branch &amp; Bound</I> from
the menu <I>Algorithms</I> and after editing the options press <I>OK</I>.
<P>
<H2>Options:</H2>
<DL>
<DT>Number of Solutions: <DD>
   LisaBB is able to compute all optimal solutions of a given
   problem. To safe time and memory, give an upper bound for the
   number of schedules in the output, normally 1.
<DT>Lower bound:<DD>
   If you know a lower bound for the objective function value, then
   enter it here. Each schedule which does not exceed this value is
   treated as optimal.
<DT>Upper bound:<DD>
   If a schedule is already known, enter its objective value here to
   make the algorithm reject all schedules with bigger objective
   value.
<DT>Insertion order:<DD>
   Chose the order in which LisaBB considers the operations. Possible
   are:
   <DL>
   <DT>LPT <DD> ordered by nonincreasing processing times
   <DT>RANDOM <DD> in random order
   </DL>
<DT>Bounding:<DD>
   Chose a procedure to compute lower bounds within the algorithm:
   <DL>
   <DT> NORMAL <DD> objective function value of partial schedule
   <DT> EXTENDED <DD> not implemented
   </DL>
</DL>
<P>
<H2>If LisaBB is too slow:</H2>
<UL>
<LI> Because LisaBB handles different kinds of problems, it cannot take
  advantage problem specific things. Use an algorithm especially
  implemented for your problem if possible.
<LI> Abort the algorithm after some time. It will output the best
  solution(s) found so far.
<LI> Try another insertion order or bounding procedure.
<LI> Find the optimal objective value with option "Number of
  solutions=1". To find further optimal solutions in a second run,
  give the optimal objective value as upper and lower bound.
<LI> If you cannot find the optimal solution, try finding a schedule
  with objective function in the interval [x,y] by giving x and y as
  lower and upper boud, respectively. However, it is possible that
  LisaBB does not find a schedule with this properties.
