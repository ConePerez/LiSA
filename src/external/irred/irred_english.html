<h2>Irreducibilitytest</h2>
     This algorithm checks if a given schedule for a problem is irreducible. A schedule S* reduces another schedule 
     S if its objective is better than that for S for any given set of processing types. S is therefore irreducible 
     if no such schedule S* exists.<br><br>It works for open, job and flow shop problems, in combination with 
     release dates and for the Cmax, Lmax, SumCi, SumWiCi, SumUi, SumWiUi, SumTi and SumWiTi objectives.
          
<h2>What you have to do:</h2>
Make sure that both a <a href="problem.html">problem type</a> and all <a href="values.html">parameters</a> are
defined and that a valid plan exists. Choose <i>Heuristic Algortihms|Irreducibilitytest</i> from the
menu <i>Algorithms</i> and after editing the options press <i>OK</i>.

<h2>Options:</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Generate plans:</dt>

<dl>
<dt>SIMILAR</dt>

<dd>If this is selected the algorithm will NOT check for irreducibility. Instead it will generate and 
    return all schedules that have the same objective as the input schedule for any given set of 
    processing times. In that case the other options do not apply.</dd>

<dt>ALL_REDUCING</dt>

<dd>The algorithm will generate all schedules that reduce the input schedule. If no such schedule exists it will 
    return the input schedule together with a warning that it's irreducible. Otherwise all genereated schedules 
    or only those irreducible may be returned. The random option does not apply here.</dd>

<dt>ITERATIVE_REDUCING</dt>

<dd>As soon as a schedule is found that reduces the input schedule the algorithm will be interrupted and restarted 
    with the new schedule. This will be repeated until an irreducible schedule is found. Schedules can be generated
    in random order so that you will get different results at successive calls with the same input schedule. If the 
    input schedule is irreducible it will be returned together with a warning. Otherwise all generated plans or
    only the last (irreducible) one may be returned.</dd>

</dl>

<dt>Return following plans:</dt>

<dl>
<dt>ALL</dt>

<dd>All generated schedules will be returned. Be aware that with the ALL_REDUCING option set this might be 
    alot of schedules.</dd>

<dt>ONLY_IRREDUCIBLE</dt>

<dd>Only the irreducible plans will be returned.</dd>

</dl>

<dt>Generate plans in random order:</dt>

<dl>
<dt>YES</dt>

<dd>The algorithm will randomize the order in which schedules are generated. This is only interesting in
    combination with ITERATIVE_REDUCING set to gather different results at successive call with the 
    same input schedule.</dd>

<dt>NO</dt>

<dd>Schedules will be generated in the must efficient order.</dd>
