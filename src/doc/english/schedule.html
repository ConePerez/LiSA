<H2>The Schedule Window</H2>

This window allows to enter a sequence or a schedule as a
matrix. Moreover, it offers more possibilities to manipulate an
existing schedule than the main window.
<P>
<H2>How to get there:</H2> 
Make shure a <A HREF="problem.html"> problem type </A> and all 
<A HREF="values.html"> problem parameter </A> are defined. 
Choose <I> Edit|Solution</I> 
<P>

<H2>General Options</H2>
Editing a schedule in this window needs some knowledge in
scheduling theory. For more information see 
<A HREF="http://lisa.math.uni-magdeburg.de/model/"> 
Latin Rectangles in Scheduling Theory - a Basic Modelling Concept</A>.
<UL>
<LI> The choice of <I>Generate|Mark as semiactive</I> forces the
     schedule to be semiactive. In this case, you cannot edit the
     schedule but only the sequence. 
<LI> You may edit the sequence by entering any matrix. Choose 
     <I>Generate|Make feasible</I> to transform your matrix into a
     feasible sequence. If your matrix was not a latin rectangle, LiSA
     will schedule jobs or machines with smaller index first.
<LI> You may generate a random sequence or reverse an existing one.
<LI> A double click on an operation will invoke the 
     <A HREF="man_oper.html"> sequence editor</A>. 
</UL>
After manipulation a sequence or schedule, you have to click the
<I>Adopt</I>-button to make your changes take effect.     
      
<H2>If this does not work:</H2>
<UL>
<LI>If a schedule is forced to be semiactive you cannot edit the
operation completion times.
<LI>Do not forget to click the
<I>Adopt</I>-button to make your changes take effect.
