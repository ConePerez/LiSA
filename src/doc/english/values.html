<H2>Input Problem Data</H2>
In order to solve a problem instance, you have to enter all needed parameters
like processing times, due dates etc.. 
 
<H2>Basic handling:</H2>
<UL>
<LI> Make shure a <A HREF="problem.html"> problem type </A> is defined 
     and choose <I> Edit|Parameters</I>.
<LI> In the opening window, use the <I>View</I>-menu to display the
     desired parameter.
<LI> Click on the item you want to edit. 
<LI> You may generate all parameters automatically using a random
     number generator.
</UL>

<H2>Options</H2>
Dependend on the choosen <A HREF="problem.html"> problem type </A> you
may edit or generate some of the following parameters.

<DL>
<DT> Processing Times: <DD>
   the time needed to carry out an operation
<DT> Operation Set: <DD>
   The entry in row i and column j is 1 if operation (i,j) exists, 0
   otherwise.
<DT>Machine Order: <DD>
   A permutation of numbers 1 to m in each row 1 describes the order
   in which job i is processed by the machines. For instance, if job 3
   has to be processed first on machine 2 and then on maschine 5,
   we write a 1 into row 3, column 2 and a 2 into row 3, column
   2. After editing this matrix you have to press the button 
   <I>Adopt Machine Orders</I>.
<DT>Due Dates: <DD>
   a time at which the corresponding job should be completed
<DT>Weights: <DD>
   are used in some objective functions
<DT>Release Times: <DD>
   a time r_i when job i becomes ready for processing
</DL>


<H2>Exceptions</H2>
<UL>
<LI>You may only edit or generate parameters which fit to the choosen 
<A HREF="problem.html"> problem type </A>.
<LI>Machine orders are only accepted if the whole matrix is filled in 
   correctly.
