<H2> Problem Classification</H2>

Please use this window for displaying the computational complexity of
the currently chosen <A HREF="problem.html">Problem Type</A> (according
to the so-called 3-field notation).
<P>
This classification is performed by an analyisof a BibTeX database
(file <I>classify.bib</I>)
which is based on the collection of complexity results for scheduling
problems, see <A
HREF="http://www.mathematik.uni-osnabrueck.de/research/OR/class/">Complexity
results of scheduling problems</A>.
<P>
<H2>How to come here:</H2> 
Make sure that you have defined a 
<A HREF="problem.html">Problem Type</A>. 
Choose the menu entry 
<I> Extras|Problem Classification</I>.
<P>
<H2>Output in the problem classification window:</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Statement which tells you if the problem is
<P>
<UL>
<LI>polynomially solvable,
<LI>pseudo-polynomially solvable,
<LI>NP-hard, 
<LI>NP-hard in the strong sense or
<LI>open.
</UL>
<P>
<LI>If the complexity of the considered problem is known then
you will find a short form of the corresponding references proving the
the stated complexity.
