<H2>Incorporating external algorithms</H2>
To use LiSA as an environment for your own algorithms, including such
highlights as automated parameter test and context sensitive menus,
please follow these steps.

<H2>Implement communication</H2>
LiSA external algorithms are given two parameters, the name of an
input and an output file. All further parameters passed to the program
are in the input file. For reading and writing <A HREF="lsafile.htm"> 
.lsa-files </A> you may use the corresponding objects from the
library. Please refere to the <A HREF="../../develop/html/aindex.html"> 
developer's manual</A>. Further communication can be done via printing
lines to the standard output: 
<UL>
 <LI> A line stating the PID of the external algorithm in the form
 "PID=2345" enables LiSA to send signals to abort it.
 <LI> A line beginning with "ERROR: " is displayed in the LiSA error
      window.
 <LI> A line beginning with "objective= " moves the progress indicator
      in the external algorithm window.
</UL>

<H2>Write an .alg-file</H2>
You have to give some very basic information about your algorithm in
form of an algorithm description file. Just copy the following 
<A HREF="example.alg"> Example </A> and modify it. If you are using
LiSA in more than one language, you have to translate this file into
each language you require.

<H2>Copy files</H2>
Copy your .alg-file into the $LISAHOME/data/alg_desc/language/english 
directory and your executable file into $LISAHOME/bin (unless statet
otherwise in the .alg-file). With the next call of LiSA a menue
compiler will be invoked which modifies the LiSA menues to include
your algorithm.
