<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >Research groups at universities are usually not homogeneously formed over a long period. The
following overview contains the names of most scientists and students who were involved in the
development of LiSA as well as their major working areas:<br

<!--l. 28--><p class="noindent" >For a short period, the following students were also involved in the project:<br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="cmti-12">Holger Hennes, Birgit Grohe, Christian Tietjen, Carsten Malchau </span>und <span 
class="cmti-12">Tanka Nath Dhamala</span>
(Sandwich fellow, Ph.D. thesis 2002). In a practical computer course 2001, <span

into LiSA.<br 
class="newline" />
<!--l. 34--><p class="noindent" >In 2002, <span 
class="cmti-12">Lars Dornheim, Sandra Kutz, Marc M</span><span 
class="cmti-12">örig und Ivo R</span><span 
class="cmti-12">össling </span>prepared LiSA for a
cooperative development. The modularity of the software has been substantially improved. Several
errors have been removed so that the software is now more stable. A specific LiSA server has been
installed for the communication between the developers and the users of LiSA, and a version
management system as well as a bug tracking system have been incorporated. The concept of
incorporating own algorithms has been improved and simplified. A new homepage has been
created. LiSA Version 2.3 was ready. For the work on LiSA, the students received the
special award of the jury at the student conference of the DMV meeting in Halle/S.
(2002).<br

<!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" >The major work on LiSA Version 3 was done by Marc Mörig, Jan Tusch, Mathias Plauschin and
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
Frank Engelhardt. The main progress in LiSA Version 3 can be described as follows:<br 
class="newline" />- The file format has been changed by <span 
class="cmti-12">Jan Tusch </span>to .xml, he also implemented the genetic
algorithms;<br 
class="newline" />- The call of algorithms has been automated by <span 
class="cmti-12">Marc M</span><span 
class="cmti-12">örig</span>, later also by <span 
class="cmti-12">Mathias Plauschin</span>
and by <span 
class="cmti-12">Frank Engelhardt</span>. They also developed further the filtering of the results into a
file compatible with Excel, implemented for the first time by <span 
class="cmti-12">Andre Herms </span>in Perl;
<br 
class="newline" />- For the Windows versions, there is an automatic installer created by <span 
class="cmti-12">Mathias Plauschin</span>,
improved by <span 
class="cmti-12">Frank Engelhardt</span>. For the use of the installer, there is no further software
required.<br 
class="newline" />For the last four years, <span 
class="cmti-12">Frank Werner </span>also collaborated with the LiSA team, mainly for
publications based on the use of algorithms in LiSA. He was responsible for the English version of
this handbook.
