<H2>The LiSA file format</H2>
Lisa uses text files to save and read problems, plans, values and configurations
 as well as for communication with external programs. Please read this documentation
 if you want to edit lisa files (*lsa) manually.



<P>
A lisa file contains entries of types 
PROBLEMTYPE, CONTROLPARAMETERS, VALUES and  SCHEDULE. 
These entries start and end with their corresponding tags as in e.g. HTML
example: 
<PRE>
&lt;PROBLEMTYPE&gt;
  (content)
&lt;/PROBLEMTYPE&gt; 
</PRE>

<H3>Entries of type PROBLEMTYPE</H3>

The syntax is
<PRE>
&lt;PROBLEMTYPE&gt;
Lisa_ProblemType= { (alpha) / (beta)  / (gamma) }
&lt;/PROBLEMTYPE&gt;
</PRE>

where the following elements may be included
<pre>
alpha: 1  one machine problem
       F  flow shop
       O  open shop 
       J  job shop
       X  mixed shop (some jobs with given machine order )
       G  general shop (arbitrary precedence constraints)
       P  identical parallel machines
       R  unrelated    "
       Q  uniform      "
     (excactly one of the elements above)
       M  machine number  fixed, but arbitrary
      <m> machine number = m (a special number for m must be set)      

beta: PMTN, INTREE, OUTTREE, TREE, SP_GRAPH, PREC, RI, DI, PIJ_1, BATCH

gamma: CMAX, LMAX, SUM_CI, SUM_WICI, SUM_UI, SUM_WIUI, SUM_TI, SUM_WITI
</PRE>

<H3> Entries of type VALUES</H3>


All entries are of the form  (keyword)= (content). 
See the list of allowed keywords below:
<pre>
n, m  job number  and machine number-  These numbers ALWAYS have to be set first.
PT    matrix of completion times        
MO    given technology(machine order) (row matrix)
PREC  precedence constrains for jobs
PREC* precedence constraints for single operations
SIJ   set of operations (0/1-matrix)
RD    release dates  (vector)    
DD    due dates      (vector)
Wi    weights        (vector)
</PRE>

The content may be a number, a vector, a matrix or a graph.
Numbers are written in C input format.
Vectors are rows of numbers separated by spaces, altogether 
included in braces, e.g. {2 3 1}. 
Note: Before and after every brace and after = has to be 
a space or a line end.  
A matrix is represented as a vector of vectors, e.g. { { 0 1 } { 1 0 } }.
Graphs are written as predecessor lists. These contain entries of the form:
N(i)= { j k l }, where nodes j, k, l are predecessors of i.
Nodes also may be ordered pairs  i.e.
N(0,0)= { (0,1) (2,4) }

<H3>Entries of type SCHEDULE</H3>

Same as values - (keyword)= (content). Allowed keywords are: 
n, m, MO, with the same meaning es explained above and

<PRE>
JO   the job order  (row matrix)
LR   the latin rectangle
Cij  the  matrix completion times. 
</PRE>

For preemption problems the keywords PPT, PMO, PJO, PLR  and PCij  are
allowed. The meaning is the same as without P, but the matrix elements may 
be lists instead.


<H3>Entries of type CONTROLPARAMETERS</H3>

One or more statements of the form (type) (keyword) (content),
where the type is restricted to long, float or String. The keyword may be 
any string without spaces and the content has to be of the specified type. 

<H3>Comments</H3>

Lisa treats everything as a comment what is written outside the  
PROBLEMTYPE, CONTROLPARAMETERS, VALUES and  SCHEDULE environment.
