<H2>Sequence Editor</H2>
LiSA allows you to manipulate any computed sequence manually by
shifting operations in a job order or machine order, respectively.
<P>
<H2>How to invoke the Sequence Editor:</H2> 
Choose an operation by double clicking on its entry in the latin
square in the <A HREF="schedule.html"> schedule window</A> (not in the 
main window) or on the corresponding rectangle in the gantt chart. In
the gantt chart this operation will be marked by a black border.
<P>
<H2>How to Shift an Operation:</H2>
To shift the choosen operation (i,j), use the following buttons in the 
sequence manipulation window
<DL>
<DT>Source <DD>
   Operation (i,j) becomes a source in the sequence granph, i.e., no
   other operation is predecessor of (i,j).
<DT>Sink <DD>
   Operation (i,j) becomes a sink in the sequence granph, i.e., no
   other operation is successor of (i,j).
<DT><img src="../../../img/lleft.xbm" BORDER=0><DD>
   Operation (i,j) is scheduled first in the machine order of job i,
   i.e. job i starts on machine j.
<DT> <img src="../../../img/left.xbm" BORDER=0><DD>
   Operation (i,j) is scheduled one position earlier in the machine
   order of job i.
<DT><img src="../../../img/rright.xbm" BORDER=0><DD>
    Operation (i,j) is scheduled last in the machine order of job i,
   i.e. job i is completed  on machine j.
<DT><img src="../../../img/right.xbm" BORDER=0><DD>
   Operation (i,j) is scheduled one position later in the machine
   order of job i.
<DT>Vertical Arrows:<DD>
   Same as the corresponding horizontical ones, but affect the job
   order of machine j instead of the machine order of job i.
<DT><img src="../../../img/reset.xbm" BORDER=0><DD>
   Restore the sequence as it was before invoking the sequence editor.
</DL>

<H2>If this does not work</H2>

<UL>
<LI> In a job shop or flow shop problem the machine orders of all jobs
   are prescribed. Thus, the correspondig buttons cannot be choosen.
<LI> Shifting an operation can create a cycle in the sequence
   graph. In this case an error message is printed and the shift is
   not carried out.
