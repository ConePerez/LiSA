<!--l. 183--><p class="noindent" >Shop problems are often modelled in the literature by the <span 
class="cmti-12">disjunctive graph model</span>, see e.g.
<span 
class="cmcsc-10x-x-120">B<span 
class="small-caps">r</span><span 
class="small-caps">u</span><span 
class="small-caps">c</span><span 
class="small-caps">k</span><span 
class="small-caps">e</span><span 
class="small-caps">r</span></span>, <span class="cite">[<a 
href="handbuchli1.html#Xbr01">8</a>]</span>. The set of vertices of the disjunctive graph are the operations which are
successively numbered and weighted by the processing times. Two vertices are joined by an edge if
they cannot be simultaneously processed, i.e. they belong to the same job or to the same machine.
There are arcs from a fictitious source to any vertex. From any vertex, there are arcs to a fictitious
sink. Precedence constrains for the operations in the job-shop and flow-shop case are
modelled by an orientation of the corresponding edge. We look for an orientation of all
edges that are still not oriented such that the resulting graph does not contain any
cycle and the weight of a critical path becomes minimal (in case of minimizing the
makespan).
<!--l. 192--><p class="noindent" >The model used in LiSA can be derived from the latter model as follows:
<!--l. 194--><p class="noindent" >- Delete the source and the sink and the incident arcs from the disjunctive graph.<br 
class="newline" />- Determine an acyclic orientation of the disjunctive graph.
<!--l. 197--><p class="noindent" >If we drop all arcs that are transitive with respect to the machine and job orders from the acyclic
orientation of the disjunctive graph, we obtain the sequence graph <span 
class="cmmi-12">G</span>(<span 
class="cmmi-12">MO,JO</span>) used in LiSA.
Moreover, a sequence is a combination of all ranks of an acyclic orientation of a disjunctive
graph.
