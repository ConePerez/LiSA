      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x117-122001xB">This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed
      by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General
      Public License. The &#8220;Program&#8221;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a
      &#8220;work based on the Program&#8221; means either the Program or any derivative work under
      copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
      verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,
      translation is included without limitation in the term &#8220;modification&#8221;.) Each licensee is
      addressed as &#8220;you&#8221;.
      <!--l. 80--><p class="noindent" >Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this
      License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted,
      and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
      on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether
      that is true depends on what the Program does.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x117-122002xB">You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#8217;s source code as you
      receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish
      on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
      all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give
      any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
      <!--l. 95--><p class="noindent" >You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your
      option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x117-122003xB">You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming
      a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work
      under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
      <!--l. 103--><p class="noindent" >
           <ol  class="enumerate2" >
           <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x117-122004xB">You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you
           changed the files and the date of any change.
           </li>
           <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x117-122005xB">You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part
           contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a
           whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
           </li>
           <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x117-122006xB">If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you
           must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary
           way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright
           notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
           warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions,
           and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program
           itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work
           based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
           </li></ol>
      <!--l. 128--><p class="noindent" >These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that
      work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and
      separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections
      when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as
      part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the
      whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees
      extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
      it.
      <!--l. 139--><p class="noindent" >Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written
      entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
      derivative or collective works based on the Program.
      <!--l. 144--><p class="noindent" >In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
      the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage
      or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
      License.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x117-122007xB">You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object
      code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do
      one of the following:
      <!--l. 153--><p class="noindent" >
           <ol  class="enumerate2" >
           <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x117-122008xB">Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,
           which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
           customarily used for software interchange; or,
           </li>
           <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x117-122009xB">Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any
           third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source
           distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code,
           to  be  distributed  under  the  terms  of  Sections  1  and  2  above  on  a  medium
           customarily used for software interchange; or,
           </li>
           <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x117-122010xB">Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute
           corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
           distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable
           form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
           </li></ol>
      <!--l. 175--><p class="noindent" >The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to
      it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it
      contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
      compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
      code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
      binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
      system n on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
      executable.
      <!--l. 186--><p class="noindent" >If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a
      designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place
      counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy
      the source along with the object code.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x117-122011xB">You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly
      provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or
      distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
      License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
      License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
      compliance.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x117-122012xB">You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,
      nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its
      derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
      Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
      Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and
      conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on
      it.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x117-122013xB">Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
      the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,
      distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not
      impose any further restrictions on the recipients&#8217; exercise of the rights granted
      herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this
      License.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x117-122014xB">If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other
      reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
      agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
      you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
      simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
      as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent
      license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
      receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could
      satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
      Program.
      <!--l. 230--><p class="noindent" >If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular
      circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is
      intended to apply in other circumstances.
      <!--l. 235--><p class="noindent" >It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property
      right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of
      protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by
      public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
      software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application
      of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
      distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
      choice.
      <!--l. 246--><p class="noindent" >This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the
      rest of this License.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x117-122015xB">If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by
      patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program
      under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
      countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In
      such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
      License.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x117-122016xB">The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
      General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
      spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
      concerns.
      <!--l. 262--><p class="noindent" >Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version
      number of this License which applies to it and &#8220;any later version&#8221;, you have the option of
      following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
      the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of
      this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
      Foundation.
      </li>
      <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x117-122017xB">If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution
      conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is
      copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
      sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
      preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
      and reuse of software generally.
