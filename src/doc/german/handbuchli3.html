<!--l. 16--><p class="noindent" >The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By
contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and
change free software&#8212;to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation&#8217;s software and to any other program
whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs,
too.
<!--l. 25--><p class="noindent" >When we speak of free software, we are refering to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses
are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that
you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can
do these things.
<!--l. 32--><p class="noindent" >To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or
to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<!--l. 37--><p class="noindent" >For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give
the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.
<!--l. 42--><p class="noindent" >We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license
which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.
<!--l. 46--><p class="noindent" >Also, for each author&#8217;s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone
understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by
someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the
original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors&#8217;
reputations.
<!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the
danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect
making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be
licensed for everyone&#8217;s free use or not licensed at all.
<!--l. 59--><p class="noindent" >The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
