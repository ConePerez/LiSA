<H2>Neighbourhood search</H2>

Neighbourhood search methods are iterative metaheuristics. With
appropriate settings, these methods can produce high-quality solutions
within a medium running time. Chose these
algorithms only if exact algorithms cannot be applied for the given
problem. 

<H2> Using neighbourhood search </H2>
We suppose that you are familiar with the basic concepts of
neighbourhood search which can be found in almost each text book about
discrete optimization. You may choose
<DL>
<DT>the neighbourhood:<DD> According to your choice, neighbours are
      generated by swappping adjacent operations (API), shifting
      operations or swap or shift blocks of operations. The influence
      of the choosen neighbourhood to the quality of the results is 
      different for each probem type. 
<DT>the search method:<DD> Implemented methods are simulated
      anealing, threshold accepting, plain iterative improvement and
      tabu search.
<DT>creating a neighbour:<DD> Creating Neighbours randomly instead of
      enumerating the whole neighbourhood may work well with iterative
      improvement and tabu search if the neighbourhood large. 
<DT>Created Solutions:<DD> gives an upper bound for the numbers of
      search vertices the algorithm will visit before terminating.

For explanation of the capabilities of the neighbourhood search modul
please refere to the neighbourhood search manual.

<H2>Trouble shooting</H2>
<UL>
<LI> If the algorithm runs too long just stop it. It will output the
best solution encountered so far.
<LI> If the quality of the obtained solution is poor you should try
     other parameters or another search method. Numerical parameters
     can be varied <A HREF="../utility/gen_ptst.html">automatically</A>.
