<h2>
Matching Heuristics</h2>
These are heuristics which create a schedule for open shop problems. They
try to order the operations that way that operations with similar processingtimes
run parallel. The progress bar will show you the current total completion
time after each insertion.
<h2>
What you have to do:</h2>
Make sure that both a <a href="../problem.html">problem type </a>and all <a href="../values.html">parameters
</a>are
defined. Choose <i>Heuristic Algortihms|Matching Heuristics</i> from the
menu <i>Algorithms</i> and after editing the options press <i>OK</i>.
<h2>
Options:</h2>

<dl>
<dt>
Kind of Algorithm:</dt>

<dl>
<dt>
BOTTLENECK</dt>

<dd>
This algorithm sorts the weightings and then searches binary for the smallest
weighting p so that&nbsp; M = {p(i,j) | p(i,j) >= p} contains a perfect
matching. The according operations are inserted into the schedule and the
weightings are deleted. This process will be iterated until all operations
have been inserted into the schedule.</dd>

<dt>
WEIGHTED</dt>

<dd>
A maximum weighted matching is calculated. The according operation are
inserted into the schedule and the weightings are deleted (eg. set to the
lowest possible value). This will be repeated until all operations have
been inserted into the schedule.</dd>

<dd>
</dd>
</dl>

<dt>
Kind of matching:</dt>

<dd>
&nbsp;This option allows you to choose which kind of weightings will be
used for the matching algorithms.</dd>

<dl>
<dt>
MIN</dt>

<dd>
All processingtimes will be subtracted from the longest possible processingtime,
the result will be used as weighting. That means the algorithm trys to
minimize the average processingtime for the inserted operations.</dd>

<dt>
MAX</dt>

<dd>
The processingtime for each operation will be used as weighting. That means
the algorithm trys to maximize the average processingtime for the inserted
operations.</dd>

<dt>
HEADS</dt>

<dd>
The first set of operations to insert will be calculated as if the MIN
parameter has been set. After inserting a set of operations the heads for
all remaining operations will be calculated and added to the processingtime
for that operation. The result will be substracted from the longest possible
processingtime and be used as weighting. That means the algorithm trys
to insert a set of operations that way, that the current total completion
time will get minimized.</dd>
