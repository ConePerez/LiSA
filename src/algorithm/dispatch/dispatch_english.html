<H2>Dispatching Rules</H2>

These are fast algorithms for solving a scheduling problem exactly or 
heuristically. Use a dispatching rule if it solves your problem
exactly or if you need a very fast algorithm.
<P>
<H2>What you have to do:</H2> 
<P>
Make sure that both a 
<A HREF="../problem.html"> problem type </A> and all 
<A HREF="../values.html"> parameters </A> 
are defined. Choose <I>Heuristic Algortihms|Dispatching Rules</I> from
the menu <I>Algorithms</I> and after editing the options press <I>OK</I>.
Dependent on the current problem type, special dispatching rules may
also be listed as exact algorithms.
<P>
<H2>Options:</H2>
<DL>
<DT> construct active schedule <DD>
   Choose an algorithm:
   <DL>
   <DT> TRUE <DD> At each time a job or machine becomes ready schedule
   the ready unscheduled operation with highest priority. The
   resulting schedule is active.
   <DT>FALSE <DD> To extend a partial schedule, among all unscheduled 
   operations without unscheduled predecessor the one with highest
   priority is appended to the schedule. The resulting
   schedule is semiactive, but in general not activ.
   </DL>
<DT>Priority<DD>
   Choose one of the following definitions of priority. The algorithm
   will schedule the operation
 <DL>
   <DT> RAND <DD> which is randomly determined,
   <DT> FCFS <DD> which became ready first,
   <DT> EDD  <DD> with the smallest due date,
   <DT> LQUE  <DD> with smallest difference due date-(processing time +
   tail). In case of open shop instead of the tail the total processing 
   processing time of all unscheduled operations of the respective job
   is considered. To break ties, the operation with largest total 
   unscheduled processing time on the corresponding machine is choosen.     	  <DT> SPT  <DD> with smallest processing time
   <DT> WSPT <DD> with smallest ratio (processing time / weight)
   <DT> ECT  <DD> which can be completed first
   <DT> WI   <DD> with biggest weight,
   <DT> LPT  <DD> with longest processing time
   </DL>
</DL>
<P>
<H2>But...</H2>
<UL>
<LI> If you call a dispatching rule as exact algorithm, normally you
  cannot choose the priority or rule type. If you want to choose, call
  <I>Algorithms|Heuristic Algorithms|Dispatching Rules</I>.
<LI> Dispatching rules will not appear in any menue if the current
  problem type cannot be handled by the implemented algorithm.
