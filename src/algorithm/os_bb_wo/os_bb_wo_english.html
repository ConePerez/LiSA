<H2> Brucker's Open-Shop B&amp;B </H2>

This algorithm was designed and implemented at the university of Osnabr&uuml;ck
by the group of Peter Brucker. It can solve problems of the type O||Cmax
exactly.

<P>
<H2>What you have to do::</H2>
<P>

Make sure that both a <A HREF="../problem.html"> problem type </A> and all 
<A HREF="../values.html"> parameters </A> are defined. Choose <I> Exact 
Algorithms|Open-Shop B&amp;B</I> from the menu <I>Algorithms</I> and after 
editing the options press <I>OK</I>. You may stop the algorithm at any time, it
will then return the best schedule found so far.

<P>
<H2>Options:</H2>
<DL>
<DT>Heuristic</DT> 
<DD>The algorithm can use various heuristics to construct/complete schedules
    in each branch node. There are more heuristics than those listed here, they 
    have however been disabled since they don't seem to work with incomplete
    operation sets.</DD>
<DL>
<DT>LB_PREC_RULE</DT>
<DD>A heuristic based on a precedence rule determined by certain lower bounds.</DD>
<DT>LB_PREC_RULE_VAR</DT>
<DD>A variation of the rule above.</DD>
</DL>
