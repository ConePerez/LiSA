<H2> partition Algorithm </H2>

Use this algorithm to solve problems of the type P2 // Cmax.
<br>It is based on a pseudopolynomial algorithm for the PARTITION problem, wich uses the principle of dynamic programming. This implementation was done in 2001 bei Claudia Isensee.

<P>
<H2>This is, how You get here:</H2> 
Make sure, that You have specified 
 <b>Problem Type</b> (P2 // Cmax)
 and <b>Parameters</b>. Choose the menu item 
<I> Algorithms|Exact Algorithms|partition-module</I>.
<P>
<a name="params"><h2>Parameters</h2></a>
The problem requires only one p<sub>i</sub> per job. Right now there is still offered a two column matrix. It is sufficient to fill in the first column of the matrix.
<p>
<H2>Problems:</H2>
<UL>
<LI> A problem of the type P2 // Cmax does not yet offer <i>partition</i> as an algorithm, therefore You have to camouflage you problem as O2 // Cmax.
<LI> Displaying the solution is only possible through opening  <i>~/.lisa/proc/algo_out.lsa</i>, for now.
