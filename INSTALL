installation of the binary distribtution:
-----------------------------------------

- please make sure that your LiSA toplevel directory path is in the old dos style format, otherwise LiSA won't be able to start properly

- start LiSA with the lisa.bat start script in LiSA's home directory or with the desktop 
shortcut or the start menu entry if created by the installation



installation of the source distribtution (UNIX like environments):
------------------------------------------------------------------

- make sure that tcl/tk and the g++ compiler are installed on your machine

- tar -xjvf lisa-XXX.tar.bz2

- cd LiSA

- ./configure --enable-release (or --enable-debug for switching on error checking)

- edit Make.Config if configure is unable to find some of the includes or 
  libraries

- optimizations (recommended, but not nessecary)
  edit Make.Config to add compiler flags like -O3 -march=pentium4, you may 
  also try to use another compiler, intels icc works fine for me, and really
  gives great results
  
- make

- ./lisa
