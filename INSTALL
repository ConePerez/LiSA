LiSA Setup Guide
================



1. Windows Systems:
-------------------

Installation with LiSASetup.exe

	There is nothing much to say here. Just double click the file LiSASetup.exe and follow
	the instructions. To uninstall LiSA, double click unins000.exe in the LiSA directory.


Installation from Source

	We create our binary distribution with cygwin (www.cygwin.com). Unfortunately, I failed
	with compiling LiSA with other tools (like MinGW or MSYS), so using cygwin will be the 
	best way to compile LiSA on Windows hosts.
	
	If not done yet, please install cygwin by double clicking the setup.exe file. Choose
	your installation path (say C:\cygwin) and the server from which you want to download 
	the packages. After that, you will be asked for the packages you want to install. 
	Now select the following packages (by a single click on 'Skip', so that instead a 
	version number appears):
	
		Devel
		  +- binutils
		  +- gcc
		  +- libxml2-devel
		  +- make
		  
		Libs
		  +- tcltk
		  
		X11
		  +- libX11
		  +- libX11-devel
		  
	Click 'Next' to begin the installation. 
	
	Now, unzip the LiSA source into the directory C:\cygwin\home\<your name>\. 
	A subfolder LiSA should now be created. Open a cygwin shell and change to that directory:
	
	->  cd /home/<your name>/LiSA
	
	Compile LiSA using the following steps:
	
	->  ./configure --enable-release
	
	configure may complain about missing X11 development files once. This is no real problem,
	as long as tcl/tk libraries have been found.
	
	-> make depend
	
	-> make
	
	On systems with a newer version of gcc installed (>= 4), some compiler warnigs may occur.
	This should be no problem, as long as no build errors happen.
	If all worked fine, a file named 'lisa' should have been created in this directory. 
	You can start LiSA with:
	
	-> ./lisa
	
	or you create a Windows distribution by entering
	
	-> make dist-cygwin
	
	This command creates a subfolder win\LiSA. Copy this folder everywhere you want (like 
	C:\Program Files\). Double click the file lisa.bat to start LiSA from your Windows
	Explorer.
	
	If you want to work with source code files (view our files or write your own to develop 
	new algorithms), you will have to use a text editor that can read and export files in 
	UNIX format, i.e. it should save line feeds as LF. The character-encoding should be 
	latin-1 (ISO 8859-1) or ANSI, otherwise the compiler might complain. I can recommend 
	TextPad for that purpose.
	
	
	
2. UNIX Systems
---------------

	Make sure you have the following packages installed (refer to your distributions's 
	documentation how to install software packages):
	
		- libX11 development files (mostly named something like libX11-dev or libX11-src)
		
		- libxml2 development files (also often named libxml2-dev or libxml2-src)
		
		- tcl and tk library 
		
		- gcc and make of course :)

	Unpack the source code into any directory you like, say this will be your home directory.
	Change to the newly created LiSA directory. 
	
	Try to configure the makefiles:
	
	-> ./configure --enable-release
	
	configure may complain about missing X11 library once, but as long as the tcl/tk library was
	found, everything is ok. If configure prints a line like 'checking for tcl library... couldn't
	find it', you will have to specify the correct paths explicitly. Look for libtcl.a and libtk.a
	(library) and tk.h/tcl.h (includes). This, for example, is the configure call I have to use 
	on my Debian system:
	
	-> ./configure --with-tcl-libraries=/usr/lib --with-tcl-includes=/usr/include/tcl --enable-release
	
	If configure then still complains, you should check your libX11-package.
	
	To build LiSA, call
	
	-> make depend
	
	-> make
	
	Ok, this should have created a script file named 'lisa' in the current directory. Start lisa 
	with the call:
	
	-> ./lisa
