installation of the binary distribtution:
-----------------------------------------

- extract lisa-XXX-bin.tar.bz2 respective lisa-XXX-bin.zip to its final place

- start setup respective setup.bat on Windows in the LiSA toplevel dir

- start LiSA with the "lisa" start script in LiSA



installation of the source distribtution (UNIX like environments):
------------------------------------------------------------------

- make sure that tcl/tk and the g++ compiler are installed on your machine

- tar -xjvf lisa-XXX.tar.bz2

- cd LiSA

- ./configure

- edit Make.Config if configure is unable to find some of the includes or 
  libraries

- optimizations (recommended, but not nessecary)
  edit Make.Config to add compiler flags like -O3 -march=pentium4, you may 
  also try to use another compiler, intels icc works fine for me, and really
  gives great results
  edit global.hpp and comment #define LISA_DEBUG this will switch off alot
  of error cecking and results in a great speed improvement
  
- make

- ./lisa
